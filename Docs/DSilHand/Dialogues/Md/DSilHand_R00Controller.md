# Quest DSilHand_R00Controller

_This quest is responsible for controlling the sequence of facts and managing the dialogues for the radiant quests. Once the radiant quests are enabled after you finish the last main quest, a random radiant quest will be picked. All radiant quests refer to job contracts. (1) Wolf Hunt: some farmers have contracted the Silver Hands to kill and wild werewolf. (2) Beast Extermination: some farmers have contracted the Silver Hands to kill an unknown beast which has been causing problems. The actual creature can be a Wild Werewolf, a Beard, a Troll, a Frost Troll, or an Icewolf, and will be randomly picked.  (3) Werewolf Lair: the Jarl contracted the Silver hands to deal with a  group of bandits whose leader is a werewolf. (4) Witch Hunter: some villagers reported the hidden place of a Glenmoril Witch. She can have a form of a Hagraven, White Hargraven, or Human Necromancer (Breton, Dark Elf, High Elf, Imperial, Orc, Redguard, or Wood Elf). You can talk with Senaar or Hillara to start the quest if they are not following you. Otherwise, you will have to talk with the one who is not following you._
