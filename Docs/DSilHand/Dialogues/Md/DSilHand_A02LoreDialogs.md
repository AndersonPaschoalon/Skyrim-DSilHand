#### DSilHand_A02Se_Topic01

**Player**: How did you join the Silver Hands?

**Senaar** (*Happy 50*): Well, it happened some years ago after I fled from Cyrodil.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleKhajiit\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Se__00011A66_1.xwm``    

**Senaar** (*Sad 50*): I was a prisoner in Bruma...I had some problems with the guards in the city.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleKhajiit\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Se__00011A66_2.xwm``    

**Senaar** (*Neutral 50*): I managed to escape and fled to Skyrim...      

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleKhajiit\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Se__00011A66_3.xwm``    

**Senaar** (*Sad 50*): When finished crossing the Pale Pass and arrived in Skyrim, I was freezing to death and starving...    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleKhajiit\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Se__00011A66_4.xwm``    

**Senaar** (*Happy 50*): Then, a Silver Hand group led by Krev found me. They gave me food and shelter.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleKhajiit\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Se__00011A66_5.xwm``    

**Senaar** (*Happy 50*): They received me as a brother. No one outside Elsweyr had ever treated me like this before.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleKhajiit\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Se__00011A66_6.xwm``    

**Senaar** (*Happy 50*): I'm here since then.

#### DSilHand_A02Hi_Topic01

**Player**: How did you join the Silver Hands?

**HIllara** (*Neutral 50*): That's a long story... I was a member of a guild of hunters in Valenwood some years ago.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_1.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Neutral 50*): And as you can imagine, the guy that attacked me was a Companion.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_10.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Happy 50*): But I always wanted to know other provinces in Tamriel.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_2.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Puzzled 50*): In my research, I heard about some werewolf hunters who resided here in Skyrim. But I could not find clear information about where they resided.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_3.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Puzzled 50*): I went to Whiterun, to seek information. But some people started to act strangely towards me.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_4.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Anger 50*): In the next day a strong guy punched me in the face, and summoned me to leave the city in twenty-four hours if I wanted to stay alive.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_5.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Sad 50*): I tried to talk with the guards, but it was useless.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_6.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Neutral 50*): On the same day I was heading back to Vallenwod.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_7.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Happy 50*): When I was outside the city, a farmer came toward me and told me where I should go to meet the Werewolf Hunters.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_8.xwm``    

**HIllara** (*Happy 50*): I joined and I'm here since then. Later I discovered that the farmer was Irrokas, our spy.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\FemaleEvenToned\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Hi__00011A67_9.xwm``

#### DSilHand_A02Fj_Topic01

**Player**: Can you tell me again how you and Krev joined the Silver Hands?

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): Yes, of course.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Fj__00011A69_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): A long time ago... Krev and I were Companions. We were almost like twin brothers, we were inseparable in the battles.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Fj__00011A69_2.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Anger 50*): But one day... We both were invited to ascend to the circle.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Fj__00011A69_3.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): Fortunately, Krev noticed what the circle was about, and we fled before being forced to drink the cursed wolf's blood.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Fj__00011A69_4.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): We fled from Whiterun, and sometime later we discovered about the Silver Hands.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Fj__00011A69_5.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Sad 50*): They didn't know but when Krev was a little kid, his mother was murdered by a werewolf...    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Fj__00011A69_6.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): Since then, we have been fighting for the Silver Hand.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Fj__00011A69_7.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): We have been hiring valiant warriors who hate werewolves and Daedra more than anything.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Fj__00011A69_8.xwm``

#### DSilHand_A02Ku_Topic01

**Player**: How did you join the Silver Hands?

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): It happened many years ago when I was still a young Orc.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_1.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Sad 50*): I was injured and could not fight. I thought that was the end for me.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_10.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Happy 50*): But suddenly Krev and Fjol appeared and killed the beast.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_11.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Happy 50*): My life had gained a new purpose since them. I'm helping with the forge since then.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_12.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): Before living here on Gallows Rock I used to live in an Orc stronghold located on Hammerfell, close to Falkreath hold.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_2.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): It was there where I learned about smiting and forging.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_3.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): We Orcs have been forging iron, steel, and orichalcum for millennia.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_4.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): But our stronghold was above a Silver Mine. And some few miles away there was an ancient Dwammer ruin.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_5.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Happy 50*): As you can imagine, I had the opportunity to experiment a lot with these materials before coming here.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_6.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Sad 50*): One day I decided to challenge the stronghold leadership, and lost the fight.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_7.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): I was lucky to escape alive. I was afraid, and hide in a cave.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_8.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Fear 50*): I thought it was a safe place, but I was wrong. A wild werewolf appeared and came after me.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_A_DSilHand_A02Ku__00011A68_9.xwm``
