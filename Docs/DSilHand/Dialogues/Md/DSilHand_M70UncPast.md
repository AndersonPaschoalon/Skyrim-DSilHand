#### DSilHand_M70FJ_Topic01

**Player**: What are going to be our next moves?

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): I just received a letter from a Silver brother who was investigating clues of the last missing Wuuthrad's  fragment in Morrowind.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FJ__0002789F_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): He discovered an ax  fragment was displayed many years ago at the Mournhold Museum of Artifacts, but disappeared during the Argonian invasion.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FJ__0002789F_2.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): But rumors emerged that a group of bandits found this fragment.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FJ__0002789F_3.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): They were last seen crossing the border near Riften, and are housed in Broken Helm Hollow.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FJ__0002789F_4.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Do you think you can handle this?    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FJ__0002789F_5.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M70FJ_Topic02

**Player**: I'll search for it!

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Good. If you find anything go look for me on Gallows Rock. I'll be attending Krev's funeral.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FJ__000278A1_1.xwm``

#### DSilHand_M70FA_Topic01

**Player**: I found the last fragment piece!

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): So the rumors were right! Incredible! The last missing piece. For ages all these pieces were lost... but now all pieces were found.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A4_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Eight with us... four with the Companions. And we will take it back!    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A4_2.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M70FA_Topic02

**Player**: How?

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): We have been planning an assault on Jorrvaskr for a long time.  But now, since they lost the last battle, they are in a weak position.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A6_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): We will enter on whiterun using a secret passage created by the companions, on the swers.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A6_3.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): We are going to attack by surprise, so we may take them out of guard.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A6_7.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Once we are inside the city, it is just a step into Jorrvaskr.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A6_8.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Once we are there, we must aim at the Circle members. Once all of them are struck down, the others should surrender.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A6_9.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): If we hit them hard enough, we may force them to transform into beasts. Another motive for the low ranks was to resign from the fight.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A6_10.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): Are you ready for the fight?    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A6_11.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M70FA_Topic03

**Player**: Yes, I'm!

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Excellent. Meet the man outside Whiterun in the next night, after Dusk.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278AA_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): Until then, use your time to select your best armor and weapon. And some healing potions. This fight is going to be though.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278AA_2.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M70FA_Topic04

**Player**: Not now...

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Ok. Come talk with me when you are ready. We need your help.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M70FA__000278A9_1.xwm``
