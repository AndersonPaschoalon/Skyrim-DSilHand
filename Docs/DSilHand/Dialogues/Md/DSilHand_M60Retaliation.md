#### DSilHand_M60FP_Topic05

**Player**: What things?

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): A long time ago... Krev and I were Companions too. We were almost like twin brothers, we were inseparable in the battles.

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M60FP__00025826_2.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Fortunately, Krev noticed what the circle was about, and we fled before being forced to drink the cursed wolf blood.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M60FP__00025826_3.xwm``
