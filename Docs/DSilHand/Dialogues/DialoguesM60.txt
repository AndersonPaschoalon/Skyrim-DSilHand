-----------------------[Stage 30]-----------------------


Sennar: Yes, we did it, we won the battle! But we lost our Leader, Krev. May his soul rest in peace in Sovngarde.

Dragonborn: Any idea why they decided to attack us today?

Silverhand: We were waiting to be attacked in retaliation of Farkas and Njada's death, but they attacked sooner than we expected... Anyway, we had an important victory tonight. Krev must be proud of us... Fjol must be notified about what happened. He must claim our leadership.  

Dragonborn: I'll notify him!

Silverhand: Good! We will be taking care of things here. We must clean up this mess, rebuild our defenses,  and make the proper funerals... Fjol will tell us the next steps.
