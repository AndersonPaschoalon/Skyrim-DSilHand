Journal:
I have met a strange man on Whiterun, who calls himself Irrokas Head-Torn. He says something sending the presence of the Daedra, and smelling a dirty dog smell. I asked him what he was talking about, and he told me to go to Gallows Rock to know the truth. 

Objective:
Investigate Gallows Rock

Journal:
I talked to a guard in front of an abandoned fort. He seemed to be a bandit, but didn't attack me. Instead, he told me that he was a Silver Hand. A  member of a Skyrim's  faction of Werewolves hunters. I asked to join, and he told me to go to Gallows Rock. 

Objective:
Investigate Gallows Rock

Journal:
When I arrived at Gallows Rock, a guard told me he was a part of the Silver Hands, a faction of werewolf hunters. When I asked to join them, he told me that I  need to prove I'm able to deal with those kinds of beasts. He sent me to Cold Rock Pass, and asked me to kill a Frost Troll... the bigger one I would find there, as a test task. Once I killed the beast, I might talk to the Silverhand leader, and ask him to join.

Objective:  
Kill a frost Troll in cold rock pass

When I arrived at Gallows Rock, a guard told me he was a part of the Silver Hands, a faction of werewolf hunters. When I asked to join them, he told me that I first need to prove I'm able to deal with those kinds of beasts, since werewolves are hard to kill. He sent me to Cold Rock Pass, and asked me to kill a Frost Troll... the bigger one I would find there. Once I killed the beast, I might talk to the Silverhand leader.

Objective: 
Report to Silver Hand guard on Gallows Rock
