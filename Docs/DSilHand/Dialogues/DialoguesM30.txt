Dragonborn: Are you Fjol?
Fjol: Yes. I'm. And I belive you are the new recruit, I'm right?

Dragonborn: Yes, you are. We found the Wuuthrad fragment on Angarvunde's treasure.
Fjol: Is that true? Brave! We are one piece closer to finish that puzzle.
Fjol: As Krev may have told you, we the Silver Hand have been search for the pieces of Wuuthrad for some centuries from now. 
Fjol: It was broken into twelve pieces hundreds of years ago. Right now, the Dogs on Whiterun have four pieces. 
Fjol: But, thanks to your help, we do have five fragments right now. 

Dragonborn: Dogs in Whiterun?
Fjol: Yes. The Companions. The members of the circle. They are werewolves. All of them.

Dragonborn: Members of the circle?
Fjol: Yes. Their leaders. They say they are all equals. That was true on the past. Centuries ago. 
Fjol: Before they started to worship Hercine. Now, all the members of the circle share the same beast blood. 

Dragonborn: How do you know that?
Fjol: This is a long history. Let's I and Krev were invited to become beasts, and refused the "gift". 
Fjol: But we didn't want to stay quiet as well. Now, they are persecuting us.  
Fjol: Enought talk about the past...  Soon we may talk more about the past. Now I need a favor.  
Fjol: Could you please talk to an informant we have on Whinterhold? He is called Nelacar. 
Fjol: Just ask him, if he still have that silver ring to sell. If he has any good news, he will find a way to tell you. 

Dragonborn: Considere the task done. 
Fjol: Good Brother! That's the spirit! Please, be discret as possible. No one should know he is our informant.

Dragonborn: Do you still have that silver ring to sell?
Nelacar: ...
(dragonborn receives a letter with some information)
"My suspects were correct. The mages of the College were able to find a piece of Wuuthrad on that ancient nordic ruin. 
Is was informed that Sergius Turrianus is studying the fragment. Search for it on his desk.
Also, I recomend you explore Dustman Cairn as well. They suspect another fragment of Wuuthrad is there. 
My informant on the college told me they were going to tell the Companions about this other fragment. So
you must be hurry, if want to take it before they.

N."

Dragonborn: I found another fragment. The mages were studying it. 
Fjol: I can't believe it. Ysgramor must be helping us from Sovngard. 

Dragonborn: Also, Nelacar has given to me this letter. 
Fjol: Let me see... That is amazing! The mages of the college have discovered another possible location for the next fragment!
Fjol: Dustman's Cairn. I know where is this place. We must be hurry! It says they were going to inform the Companions about the location. 
Fjol: We must go fast and be there as soon as possible. I'll mark the location on your map. I'll make the arrangements and gather some 
Fjol: manpower for the excavations. Meet me there in a few hours. I'll make the location on your map.   

Dragonborn: I'll be there. 
Fjol: Good! Before we continue, I need to thank you for your efforts.
Fjol: Take this sword as a reward for your efforts. It is a silver sword, but with a secret tempering method that uses dwemer oil. 
Fjol: This tempering makes it become as hard as ebony.
