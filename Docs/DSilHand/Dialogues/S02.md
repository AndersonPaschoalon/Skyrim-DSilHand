* DSilHand_S02TWF_Topic01

    Dragonborn: Any new work to do?

    Fjol: Yes, I have. On my research, I discovered a book about the Totems of Hircine. 

    FJol: Ancient artifacts related to the cult of Hircine and Lycanthropy.

* DSilHand_S02TWF_Topic02

    Dragonborn: Totems of Hircine?

    Fjol: Yes. There are three: a thigh bone, a carved Skull, and a Drum.

    Fjol: I was searching for clues about where they might be and how to destroy them.

    Fjol: Now I think I discovered where they may be, and how to banish them.

    Dragonborn: Banish them?

    Fjol: Yes. Since they are daedric artifacts, once they are destroyed there is no guarantee they are gone to come back someday.
