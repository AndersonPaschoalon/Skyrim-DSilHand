**Player**: Are you Kurdak?

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Surprise 50*): Yes, I'm. I believe you are the new recruit, right? I heard a lot about you.

#### DSilHand_iS01FM_Topic02

**Player**: Fjol told me you could tell me more about this secret silver tempering method.

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): Ah, yes... Fjol discovered this method on some ancient books he found in a lost ruin.

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): We worked hard on mastering the method. After many tries, we could reconstruct this ancient recipe.

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): Unfortunately, we are running out of the materials required.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleOrc\DSilHand_i_DSilHand_iS01FM_0003F789_3.xwm``    

**Kurdak Golpbu** (*Neutral 50*): Let's make a deal: you go search for the materials, I will teach you everything I know about silver forgering.
