D: It 's done...
Sennar: Yes, we did, we won the battle! But we lost our Leader, Krev. May his soul rest in peace in Sovngarde.

D: Any idea did they decide to attack us? 
Sennar: We were waiting to be attacked in retaliation to Farkas and Njada's death. But they attacked sooner than we expected. 
Sennar: Anyway, we had an important victory tonight. Krev must be proud of all of us now. Listen, Fjol needs to be notified of what happened. 
Sennar: Since he was the second in charge, he must claim our leadership now.  

DSilHand_M60SE_Topic03
D: I'll notify him!
Sennar: Good! We will be taking care of things here. We must clean up this mess, rebuild our defenses, and make the proper funerals. 
Sennar: Fjol will tell us the next steps.

Fjol: Come on in. What brings you here?

DSilHand_M60FP_Topic02
D: The companions have just attacked Gallows Rock. But we defeated them. 
Fjol: By the nine! Did we have many casualties?

DSilHand_M60FP_Topic03
D: Yes... many brothers  have fallen, including our leader Krev...
Fjol: No... Krev... My best friend... but... He must be  better  than us now, for sure! 
Fjol: He must be drinking the most delicious mead, with the most delightful woman in Sovngarde. 
Fjol: And about the Companions... How many of them were werewolves? 

DSilHand_M60FP_Topic04
D: Three, including  Aela and Skjor!
Fjol: Even though many of us have perished, this was a great victory for sure.
Fjol: You know I must tell you some things... 

DSilHand_M60FP_Topic05
D: What things?
Fjol: A long time ago... Krev and I were Companions too. We were almost like twin brothers, we were inseparable in the battles. 
Fjol: But one day...  We both were invited to ascend to the circle. 
Fjol: Fortunately, Krev noticed what the circle was about, and we fled before being forced to drink the cursed wolf blood. 
Fjol: Since then, we have been fighting for the Silver Hand. They didn't know... but Krev's mother was murdered by a werewolf... 
Fjol: We have been hiring valiant warriors who hate werewolves and Daedra more than anything.  
Fjol: Now, the Silver Hand had grown stronger than ever.  But enough talk. We must celebrate our victory.  Come on, let's celebrate!
