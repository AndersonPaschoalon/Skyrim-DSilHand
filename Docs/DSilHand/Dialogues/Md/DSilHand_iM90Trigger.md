#### DSilHand_iM90_AF_Topic01

**Player**: Fjol, I've found Kodlak journal.

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Ow... let me see....    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_i_DSilHand_iM90_A_00049F51_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): ... I see... So what Vignar said was true... Kodlack was trying to find a cure...

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): So... the witches responsible for the curse are on Glenmoril Coven...    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_i_DSilHand_iM90_A_00049F51_3.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): He believed that he could achieve the cure burning a Witch head in the Flame of the Harbinger...    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_i_DSilHand_iM90_A_00049F51_4.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Since he has regret at the end of his life, the least we should do is to try to save his soul in that way.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_i_DSilHand_iM90_A_00049F51_5.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): We shall do that in honor of Ysgramor.
