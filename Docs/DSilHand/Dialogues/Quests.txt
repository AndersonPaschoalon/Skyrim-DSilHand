When I arrived at Gallows Rock, a guard told me he was a part of the Silver Hands, a faction of werewolf hunters. When I asked to join them, he told me that I  need to prove I'm able to deal with those kinds of beasts. He sent me to Cold Rock Pass, and asked me to kill a Frost Troll... the bigger one I would find there, as a test task. Once I killed the beast, I might talk to the Silverhand leader, and ask him to join.

When I arrived at Gallows Rock, a guard told me he was a part of the Silver Hands, a faction of werewolf hunters. When I asked to join them, he told me that I first need to prove I'm able to deal with those kinds of beasts, since werewolves are hard to kill. He sent me to Cold Rock Pass, and asked me to kill a Frost Troll... the bigger one I would find there. Once I killed the beast, I might talk to the Silverhand leader.
