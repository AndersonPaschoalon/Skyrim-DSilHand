Dragonborn: You seems worried about something...
Silver Hand: I can smell wolfs nearby. My senses do not fool me. There is daedric influence nearby.

Dragonborn: What are you talking about?
Silver Hand: I can sense the presence of evil daedra nearby. Go to gallows rock, if you want to know the truth.

Dragonborn: What should I do to join? 
Silver Hand Guard: Go to Cold Rock Pass and kill the Frost Troll that is living there, the bigger one, and come back with a proof of your hunt. Than we may talk again. 
Silver Hand Guard: If  you are unable to kill that frost troll, you will be unable to kill werewolves anyways.

[Dragonborn retorna a Gallows Rock depois de matar o frost troll]
Dragonborn: I killed the toll in Cold Rock Pass. Here is its Skull.
Silver Hand Guard: I know you would be able to do it. Go talk to "Krev the Skinner", our leader. He is inside, on the main Hall. Go talk to him. Good Luck!

---------------------------------[M10: Gallows Rock Krev Meet]---------------------------------

[Dragonborn se Aproxima de "Krev the Skinner" depois de entrar em Gallows Rock pela primeira vez]

Dragonborn: Are you Krev the Skinner? I'm here bacause I want to join the Silver Hand. 
Krev: Yes I'm! Welcome! You did well against the frost troll on the Cold Rock Pass. Congratulations! You proceed well on our initiation. 
Krev: But, before we proceed, I have a question. Why do you want to join the Silver Hands?

Dragonborn: I want to hunt Werewolfs.
OR
Dragonborn: I want to fight against the influence of Daedra in Skyrim.
Krev: An adventure seeker eh? We need more people like you here. 
Krev: This is an honor cause that every sons and daughters of Skyrim who wish to go Sovengard one day, must fight for.
Krev: But I have more things to say before you can join us. 

Dragonborn: What things?
Krev: We fight against these beasts to cleanse this foul daedric disease that has taken the sanity of many of our brothers and sisters here on Skyrim.
Krev: But worst than that, have corrupted the souls of many sons of Skyrim, and take them away from Sovengard in exchange of an ephemeral power in life.
Krev: But, you must be aware. No only beggars and forgotten people have lycantropy here on Skyrim. 
Krev: Many influential and rich people have this curse... or "gift" as many of them say. 
Krev: If you become a Silver Hand, you will have to fight not only physically, but also politically and economically powerful people. 
Krev: After all I said, do you still want to become a Silver Hand?

Dragonborn: Yes, I do!
Krev: Now, you are officially a silver hand initiate. Take this armor and shields. 
Krev: They are not expensive ones, but are especially good to protect against the cold weather of the ice fields.
Krev: Also, take this weapon, a Silver sword. This one will protect you against foul creatures we fight against.

(fur armor e iron shield added)
(silver short sword added)

Krev: Now we know you are able to deal with werewolves. As a silverhand initiate, we have a first task for you. Go to Dustman's Cairn. 
Krev: Meet the brothers on the entrance of the tumb, and help them retrieve the lost Fragment of Wuuthrad.

Dragonborn: Fragment of Wuuthrad?

Krev: Yes. Wuuthrad is a legendary axe owned by the great nord hero Ysgramor, our spíritual patron and guide of our group. 
Krev: But it was broken into pieces many centuries ago. 
Krev: We have been investigating  and searching all over Skyrim to find all pieces since the beginning of the Silver Hand. 
Krev: We were able to find many of them. Now we have enough clues to believe that one of the last fragments lies on Dustman Cairn. 
Krev: We need to investigate, before the damn Companions put their dog dirty hands on it.
Krev: That's because we belive The Companions, our greatest enemies, might alread know that.
Krev: What they do not have in brains, they have on good contacts.
Krev: By the way, as you may aready imagine, the Companions veterans are Werewolfes. All of them. 
Krev: They have that smalltalk about Nord proud and Ysgramor, but the thuth is: they are traitors servants worshipers of Hercine. 
Krev: Just the newcomers are not yet, but make no mistake. Many of them know about this "secret" and are still loyal.
Krev: But, enough talk. You must go to Dustman Cairn now! 

Dragonborn: I’ll retrieve the Fragment to honor Ysgramor.

Krev: Perfect. You you find the rest of the man on the entrance of the Dustman Cairn. They you aid you on this task. 
Krev: If you find the fragment, give it to Fjol's hand. He is the leader of Driftshade Refuge.

Dragonborn: Considere the task done. 

Krev: That is the spirit  brother! Once you complete the task, you may ask any doubt you have to Fjol. He is the bigger brain we have.
