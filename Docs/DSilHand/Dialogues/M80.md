    Fjol: Brothers! We did it! We cleaned the Circle from this wolf abomination curse! 

    Fjol: Put down the weapons. The Companions are not our enemies. They are our Brothers in blood. A long time ago all of us were companions. 

    Fjol: But many did not accept the beast blood  curse brought by the Witches Glenmoril into the heart of the Companions. 

    Fjol: Since then we split into two separated groups, and we have been fighting for centuries. 

    Fjol: But now, the Circle was defeated and Companions are free from the Daedric curse! It's time to rejoy again!

* DSilHand_M80SA_Topic04

    Vignar: So it happened.... Krev is dead too. It has passed a long time since I, Kodlack, Krev and you were friends.

    Vignar: We fought together many times in the past... But Krev and you decided to follow the discidents's path. 
    
    Vignar: Kodlack decide to join the Circle. He thought it was the right thing to do. 

    Vignar: You know... Kodlack was searching for a cure. I think he was feeling this day was comming...It was only a matter of time.

    Vignar: I will not perpetuate this bloodshed. As the elder Companion member I offer you a peace agreement. 
    
    Vignar: No more cursed blood among the Companion, no more fight against the dissidents. But I have two conditions. 

    Vignar: First, the cursed blood has gone, but lets keep as a secret. No one need to know the rumors are indeed true.
    
    Vignar: Second: I cannot let you and your group rejoin the Companions. After all of this, it would not be accepted by any of the major houses. 

    Vignar: At least not for a long time.


* DSilHand_M80SA_Topic05

    Fjol: Actually, I did not want to come back either. After so many years in the wilds, I get used to it.

    Fjol: The silence and the solitude of the northern wilds and winds are part of me now.

    Fjol: The vengeance has been made, the cursed blood is no more, and the pride of Ysgramour is restored.

    Fjol: It costed the blood of many generations, and the wounds were deep.  I hope some day they will be healed.


* DSilHand_M80SA_Topic06

    Vignar: So that's it. You need to leve as soon as possible. Athis, come here.

* DSilHand_M80SA_Topic07

    Athis: Yes sir...

* DSilHand_M80SA_Topic08

    Vignar: Since Kodlak died, We need a new harbinger. I think it should be you.

* DSilHand_M80SA_Topic09

    Fjol: Virnar, the Companions were meant to be brothers sworn by blood, not by leadership. There should be no harbinger. Not for a long time, at least.

* DSilHand_M80SA_Topic10

    Vignar: Hmm, I think you're right. We've seen the secrets that can harm our faction.

* DSilHand_M80SA_Topic11
