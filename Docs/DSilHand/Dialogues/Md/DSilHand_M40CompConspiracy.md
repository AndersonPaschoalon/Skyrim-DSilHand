The quest is given by Fjol just after you bring him Nelacar's letter. The letter says a fragment could be hidden deep into the Dustman's Cairn ruins. Therefore Fjol advises you to meet him there for the excavations. Once you leave Driftshade Refugee, you will be able to find Fjol at the entrance of the ruins. After talking with him, he will start to follow you. The boulders blocking the passage inside the ruins are removed at this point, and you will be able to explore the dungeon. Once you arrive in the first chamber, Farkas and his Shield brother will appear and attack you. Once you defeat them both, you will be able to continue the exploration. You will be able to meet many silver hands inside the ruins. Some will follow you to the main chamber, and some will stand guard. In the Dungeon Main Chamber, you will be able to find the Axe fragment on the Altar. You will have to defeat the boss and talk with Fjol once more. You will deliver the Fragment to Fjol. He will send you to talk with Krev. Talking with him, the quest will be completed._
