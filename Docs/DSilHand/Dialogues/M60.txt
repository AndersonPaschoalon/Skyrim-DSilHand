[Dragonborn]:  It's done...
[Silverhand]: Yes, we did, we won the battle! But we lost our Leader, Krev. May his soul rest in peace in Sovngarde.

[Dragonborn]: Any idea why the Companions attacked today? 
[Silverhand]: We were waiting to be attacked in retaliation to Farkas and Njada. But they attacked sooner than we expected. Anyway, we had an important victory! We defeated three members of the circle. Krev must be proud of us now. Fjol must be notified of what happened. He is the first after Krev... he must claim our leadership!

[Dragonborn]: I’ll notify him!
[Silverhand]: Good! We will be taking care of things here. We must rebuild our defenses, and make a proper funeral for our fallen brothers.
