D: What are going to be our next moves?
Fjol: I just received a letter from a Silver brother who was investigating clues of the last missing Wuuthrad's  fragment in Morrowind. 
Fjol: He discovered an ax  fragment was displayed many years ago at the Mournhold Museum of Artifacts, but disappeared during the Argonian invasion. 
Fjol: But rumors emerged that a group of bandits found this fragment. They were last seen crossing the border near Riften, and are housed in Broken Helm Hollow. 
Fjol: Do you think you can handle this?

D: I'll search for it!
Fjol: Good. If you find anything go look for me on Gallows Rock. I'll be attending Krev's funeral.

D: I found the last fragment piece!
Fjol: So the rumors were right! Incredible! The last missing piece. For ages all these pieces were lost... but now all pieces were found. 
Fjol: Eight with us... four with the Companions. And we will take it back!

D: How?
Fjol: We have been planning an assault on Jorrvaskr for a long time.  But now, since they lost the last battle, they are in a weak position.
Fjol: The attack is going to be made by three groups. We will go on the lead group. 
Fjol: We will enter on whiterun using a secret passage created by the companions, on the swers. 
Fjol: The second group is composed of infiltrated silver hands in whiterun, which are ready to our command. 
Fjol: The third group will be outside Whiterun. They will provide aid if needed, and will enter the city, taking advantage of the distraction caused. 
Fjol: Are you ready?

DSilHand_M70FA_Topic03
D: Yes, I'm!
Fjol:  Excellent. Meet the man outside Whiterun on the Night. 

DSilHand_M70FA_Topic04
D: Not now...
Fjol: Ok. Come talk with me when you are ready. We need your help.
