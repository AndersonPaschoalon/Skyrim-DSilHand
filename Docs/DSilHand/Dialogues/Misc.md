    Dragonborn: Are you Kurdak?

    Kurdak: Yes, I'm. I believe you are the new recruit, right? I heard a lot about you.

* DSilHand_iS01FM_Topic02

    Dragonborn: Fjol told me you could tell me more about this secret silver tempering method.

    Kurdak: Ah, yes... Fjol discovered this method on some ancient books he found in a lost ruin. 

    Kurdak: We worked hard on mastering the method. After many tries, we could reconstruct this ancient recipe. 

    Kurdak:  Unfortunately, we are running out of the materials required.  

    Kurdak: Let's make a deal: you go search for the materials, I will teach you everything I know about silver forgering.

    Dragonborn: Now now.

    Kurdak: Ok. Come back if you change your mind. 

* DSilHand_iS01FM_Topic04

    Dragonborn: Deal!

    Kurdak: Perfect! I need 20 vessels of Dwrammer oil, 20 pots of fire salts, 10 pots of void salts and 20 ingots of quicksilver.

* DSilHand_iM90_AF_Topic01

    Dragonborn: Fjol, I've found Kodlak journal.

    Fjol: Ow... let me see....

    Fjol: ... I see... So what Vignar said was true... Kodlack was trying to find a cure...

    Fjol: So... the witches responsible for the curse are on Glenmoril Coven...

    Fjol: He believed that he could achieve the cure burning a Witch head in the Flame of the Harbinger...

    Fjol: Since he has regret at the end of his life, the least we should do is to try to save his soul in that way.  

    Fjol: We shall do that in honor of Ysgramor.
