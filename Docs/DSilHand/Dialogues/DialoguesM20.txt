# Dialogue

-----------------------[Stage 10]-----------------------
Dragonborn: What will be my first job?
Krev: Actually, I have a first task for you. Have you heard about the Wuuthrad ax?

Dragonborn(a): No, never.
Dragonborn(b): I'm not sure...
Krev: The Wuuthrad ax is a legendary weapon owned by the great Nord hero, Ysgramoor, the spiritual leader of our group.
Krev: The legends say it was forged by his son, Yngol, a day after the Night of Tears. 
Krev: He used the tears of grief from his father, made of pure ebony.  
Krev: But it was broken into dozens of pieces, many centuries ago.
Krev: The fragments were spread all across Tamriel. We, the Silver Hands, have been looking for the fragments since our foundation.
Krev: I received a letter this morning from Fjol, the leader of the Driftshade Refugee camp, the second after my command.  
Krev: His research led him to conclude that a possible location of one of the remaining fragments is an old Nordic ruin on the Rift.
Krev: Talk to Hillara. She will accompany you on this adventure.

-----------------------[Stage 20]-----------------------
Dragonborn: Krev said that we will look for the Wuuthrad ax.
Hillara: Aw yes. He told me that Fjol found evidence of the whereabouts. He believes that one of the remaining fragments is part of the Angarvunde treasure.
Hillara: I'll mark the location of the tomb on your map. It is located between Riften and Ivarstead. 

Dragonborn: Let's go!
Hillara: Lead the way.

-----------------------[Stage 40]-----------------------
Hillara: We did it! You found the fragment! Let not waste any time. We must return to Gallows Rock and bring the to Krev. 

Krev: By Ysgramor! You did it. You find the fragment! Fjol was right once again about this location. Congradulations. You are doing very well brother.
