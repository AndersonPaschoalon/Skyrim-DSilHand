# Quest DSilHand_M10SilverHunt

_It is the first quest for the mod Down of the Silver Hand. The player to start it must talk with three different people: a spy on The Drunk Huntsman on Whiterun, the Gallow�s Rock�s guard, or the Driftshade Refuge�s guar. In any case, the Gallows Rock�s guard will give a quest to kill a Frost Troll, and bring its Skull. After that, you will be allowed to talk to the Silver Hand leader: Krev the Skinner, and ask permission to join. Note: if you join the Companions before completing this quest, it will fail, and the Silver Hands will become hostile to you._
