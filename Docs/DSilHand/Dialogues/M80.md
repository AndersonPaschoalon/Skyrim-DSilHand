Fjol: Brothers! We did it! We cleaned the Circle from this Wolf abomination curse! 
Fjol: Put down the weapons. The Companions are not our enemies. They are our Brothers in blood. A long time ago all of us were companions. 
Fjol: But many did not accept the beast blood  curse brought by the Witches Glenmoril into the heart of the Companions. 
Fjol: Since then we split into two separated groups, and we have been fighting for centuries. 
Fjol: But now, the Circle was defeated and Companions are free from the Daedric curse! It's time to rejoy again!
