# Quest DSilHand_M90HonYsgramor

_This is the last main quest for the mod and is started when the player brings the Kodlaks diary to Fjol, after the reforging o Wuuthrad. Fjol discovers Kodlak regret and learns the location of the Glenmoril Witches who started the Werewolf curse over the Companions. Fjol and the player go hunt down the witches and take their heads to burn in the eternal flame in the Ysgramour tomb. They defeat the witches, collect their heads, and use Wuuthad as a key to gain access to Ysgramor's tomb. In the main chamber, they burn the witches' heads and free Kodlak soul from the wolf spirit. Now, Kodlak can rest in peace in Sovngarde. Fjol offers you the leadership of the Silver Hands. If you accept, he will give you the ax, and you will unlock the side quest 'Iconoclastic Revenge'. If you do not accept at this moment, you may accept later._
